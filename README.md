# Masterminds
Masterminds is a web-based application based on a board game Codenames.

In the game, there are two competing teams: the Purple Team and the Green Team. Each team will have a subset of words belonging to them, which they will need to guess to win the game. Teams are split into the two roles of Mastermind and Minion, where the Mastermind provides clues and the Minions guess words that relate to the clue. Each team alternate turns for giving clues and guessing until the end of the game. Whichever team guesses all of their words correctly wins.
